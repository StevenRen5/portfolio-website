This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created it by following the [How To Web Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTPO6fKtBvM) YouTube Tutorial, which helped me enhance my frontend development skills. This is my third web development project. 

## Features

- Fully responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- Clean and modern layout with smooth navigation
- Use of **CSS variables** for consistent and easy-to-manage styling
- Interactive elements powered by JavaScript, including a mobile-friendly hamburger menu
- Visual enhancements using CSS properties such as **rem** for scalable units, **transform** for animations, and **linear-gradient** for appealing backgrounds

## Learning Outcomes

- Learned how to implement and use CSS variables to streamline styling
- Gained experience using CSS units like rem to improve scalability and responsiveness
- Practiced using CSS transform for subtle animations and effects
- Applied linear-gradient to create visually appealing background effects
- Strengthened skills in building responsive layouts and interactive navigation using CSS properties like **display**, **position**, and **media queries**
