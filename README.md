# Steven Ren Portfolio

## Professional Portfolio Website

We put together this portfolio website for Steven Ren, who's a friend and needed help getting his work online. He was running into some warnings and issues with his original site, so we rebuilt it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site shows off his projects and skills in a clean way that works on any device. We made sure the layout adapts well to phones and tablets, added a mobile menu that slides in when you tap the hamburger icon, and used CSS variables to keep the styling consistent throughout. The design includes smooth animations and gradients that give it a modern feel without being too flashy.
